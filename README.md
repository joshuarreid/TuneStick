## About

TuneStick is a lightweight interface for exploring album artwork, viewing album details, and selecting favorites. It's intended as a demo/showcase of a responsive album grid with modern card interactions (including a subtle, lighter white shadow on hover for album cards).

Key intents:
- Browse albums in a clean, responsive grid.
- See album details and previews.
- Select and save favorites for quick access.
- Simple, component-based React code suitable for learning or extension.
