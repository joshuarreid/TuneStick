# TuneStick

A small React app for selecting albums and preparing them for transfer to a USB drive so you can listen in the car. The goal is to bring intentionality back to music listening by making it easy to curate and export focused, album-first collections.

## About

TuneStick helps you browse album artwork, pick albums or playlists, and export a USB-ready folder of tracks to copy to a car stereo.\  
It emphasizes deliberate listening: pick what you want to hear, export it to a USB drive, and enjoy without distractions.

Key intents:
- Curate album-based listening sessions for in-car use.
- Export selected albums to a folder suitable for copying to a USB drive.
- Promote intentional, offline listening rather than endless streaming.

## Features

- Select and preview albums in a clean, responsive grid.
- Export selected albums as a USB-ready folder you can copy to a drive.
- Modern album-card hover with a light white glow for better focus.
- Sidebar navigation and simple playlist/favorites management.
- Built with React and `react-router-dom`.
